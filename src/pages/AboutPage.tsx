            <p>A young Josiah Queen, only 9 years old, attended a young adults’ conference with tens of thousands of believers in Kansas City, accompanied by his parents. Amidst the buzz of the event, he encountered God for the first time, and his life was completely changed. After this event, Josiah recalls having the desire to write and record his own songs.</p>
            <p>On weekends, Josiah would travel with his mother, who was a traveling preacher. He would lead worship alongside these communities of believers and witnessed the powerful impact a song could have. At 18, while working at a car wash, he fervently prayed for a path that would enable him to turn his musical dreams of becoming a songwriter into reality. Josiah felt an undeniable calling to share the songs that he wrote in his bedroom with the world. Social platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram became his stage, and his music resonated deeply with hearts far and wide. With each upload, a community blossomed, drawn to the authenticity of his verses and the sincerity of his devotion.</p>
            <p>Then, in April, a song emerged that would amplify the impact of his journey titled “I am Barabbas” which found it's way to over 2M views on Tik Tok organically. This composition offered a poignant perspective on a Biblical narrative. The emotional depth of the song struck a chord, amassing millions of views on socials and earning a place among Billboard’s “Top 50 Hottest Christian Songs.”</p>
            <p>As an independent musician without a record deal, Josiah Queen stands as a testament to the power of dedication and the resonance of a harmonious melody with a global audience reaching 216M total streams. Since the release of his first single, he has since released several other songs including the biggest to date “The Prodigal” which has reached over 82M global streams and over 80k UGC uses with over 50M views on social content utilizing the track. The song has had immense success being named Apple Music’s Top 100 Songs of 2023 and hit #10 on the AC radio chart earlier this year. Queen has had continued success at Spotify including playlists across multiple genres such as Homegrown, Juniper, Top Christian & Gospel and Singled Out reaching over 2.5M monthly listeners and several songs reaching Top 50 Spotify Viral Songs charts for multiple weeks. Josiah was recently named one of Amazon’s Breakthrough Artists to Watch for 2024 and just wrapped his first-ever headline tour, selling out the entire tour across 24 cities with a fall leg of the tour just announced and selling fast. Queen continues to grow and impact with the church and global music audiences. His journey, crafted with faith-filled lyrics and heartfelt melodies, is an anthem of authenticity and devotion that's resonated with fans of all ages. Josiah and his wife, Trinity, travel together and are based in Tampa, Fl.</p>
